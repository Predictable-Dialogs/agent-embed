We are planning to refactor the files 
- components/Bot.tsx
- components/StreamConversation/*

We need to write tests so that after the refactor we can be sure that we have not broken anything. The areas which need to be planned for are as below, these are guidance areas and not specific tests needed.

File: components/Bot.tsx
## Session & persistence (localStorage, namespaced)
- Per-agent namespacing: storage keys are prefixed with ${agentName}_.
- Reads on mount: sessionId, agentConfig, customCss, and chatMessages.
- Conditional restore: if props.stream && props.persistSession and stored data exists, it restores persisted messages/config/session and skips a fresh fetch.
- Writes on change: persists customCss, sessionId, and agentConfig whenever those signals update from the API.
- Session expiry flow: clears session & messages, shows an ‚Äúexpired‚Äù state briefly, then re-initializes after 1.5s.

### Storage keys used
- sessionId, agentConfig, customCss, chatMessages, and a global debugMode.

## Input & initial state shaping
Client vs server input precedence: uses props.input if present; otherwise uses data.input from the API.
currently there is a createEffect which tracks changes to props.input after mount and updates the initial input accordingly, but after refactor this could be consolidated so tests should not be on the specifics, rather it should cover the precedence given to props.input.

## Theming & styling
 - Custom CSS injection: applies customCss from the server in a <style> tag and persists it to localStorage. The test should not be specific to the implementation, but should ensure that the customCss is applied and also persisted.
 - Immutable base CSS: injects immutableCss stylesheet to stabilize core styles.
 - Theme variables: calls setCssVariablesValue(theme, container) to apply CSS variables from agentConfig.theme to the component root.

### Web font management:
 - Injects a <link id="bot-font"> to Bunny Fonts matching agentConfig.theme.general.font (default ‚ÄúOpen Sans‚Äù).
 - Skips reinjection if the same font is already active.



## Responsiveness & environment
 - Mobile breakpoint detection: ResizeObserver on the container updates a global isMobile signal when width < 400px.
 - Cleanup: unobserves the container and resets isInitialized on unmount.

## Rendering & composition
- Branding toggle: conditionally displays <LiteBadge /> when agentConfig.settings.general.isBrandingEnabled is true.


## Defensive behavior & UX guards
- Robust error states: clear, user-facing messages for closed/missing agents and generic init failure.


File: components/StreamConversation/StreamConversation.tsx
## Session & error handling
- Tracks a ‚Äúlong request‚Äù timer; after 2s shows a loading skeleton (LoadingChunk via isSending()).
- Clears the timer and hides the loader when an assistant message arrives.
- On errors, displays ErrorChunk; if the message is ‚ÄúSession expired‚Ä¶‚Äù, calls props.onSessionExpired?.().

## Scroll & display control
- Maintains a displayIndex() to control which assistant message is revealed/animated (handles the special case where the first assistant message is not streamed).
- Auto-scrolls to the latest message after mount and after assistant messages; enables smooth scrolling only after initial layout (scroll-smooth, ready classes).

## Rendering pipeline
- Renders a scrollable chat container and a <For> list of ChatChunk components
- Shows LoadingChunk while waiting and ErrorChunk on error
- Adds a BottomSpacer to keep the input area comfortably visible.

## Status-aware behaviors
- When status() === 'ready' and the last message is an assistant message (non-streamed), sets displayIndex and scrolls.


  ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

  Testing Infrastructure:
  - Installed and configured Vitest with @solidjs/testing-library and jsdom
  - Set up comprehensive mocking for localStorage, ResizeObserver, and
  external dependencies
  - Created reusable test utilities and mock factories
  - Added test scripts to package.json with coverage support

  Test Coverage Areas:

  Bot.tsx Tests:
  - Session & Persistence: Namespaced storage, state restoration, session
  expiry flows
  - Input & Theming: Props precedence, CSS injection, font management,
  theme variables
  - Environment & UI: Mobile detection, responsive behavior, branding
  display, error states

  StreamConversation.tsx Tests:
  - Session & Display: Long request timers, error handling, display index
  control, scroll behavior
  - Rendering Pipeline: Message rendering, persistence handling,
  conditional states, storage integration

  Integration Tests:
  - Component communication flows, error propagation, theme integration,
  cleanup behavior

  üéØ Key Benefits for Refactoring

  1. Behavioral Safety Net: Tests focus on "what" components do rather than
   "how" they do it
  2. Regression Prevention: Comprehensive coverage of critical user-facing
  behaviors
  3. Refactoring Confidence: Clear success/failure indicators for
  post-refactor validation
  4. Documentation: Tests serve as living documentation of expected
  behaviors

  üìä Test Results Status

  - ‚úÖ Basic Setup: Core testing infrastructure works correctly
  - ‚úÖ Test Organization: Well-structured test files covering all specified
   areas
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Component Tests: Some async timing challenges with SolidJS component
   testing
  - ‚úÖ Mock Strategy: Comprehensive mocking prevents external dependencies
  and side effects
