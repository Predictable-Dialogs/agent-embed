## Fixed Input Feature Bug Description

The requirements for the fixed input feature is specified in this file: `js/src/__features__/Fixed-Input/fixed-input-bottom-requirements.md`

The implementation largely followed the instructions here: `js/src/__features__/Fixed-Input/fixed-input-bottom-analysis.md`

Now after the implementation there are the following issues:

1. The Logo is not visible, it should be visible in between the input and the end of the container.
2. The Enter button is touching the end of the input container.
3. There is a gradient or border between the chat container and the container which contains the input element.
