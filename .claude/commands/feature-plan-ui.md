**FEATURE PLAN COMMAND**

**Variables:**
feature_spec: $ARGUMENTS

**ARGUMENTS PARSING:**
Parse the following arguments from "$ARGUMENTS":
1. `feature_spec` - Path to the file which contains specs for the feature.

**DOC & CODE ANALYSIS**
- Read and deeply understand the feature specs using doc at `feature_spec`.

**FEATURE PLANNING**
- Read the feature specification file at `feature_spec`. Then think step-by-step and outline all the refactor steps needed. Do not write the code yet. 
â€“ The implementation could impact multiple files, the analysis should present the changes needed across the entire code base, file by file.

# Implementation rules:
The plan should contain a reference to the implementation rules at `agent-embed/js/src/__rules__/implementation-rules.md`

# UI TESTING
The plan should contain the instructions for UI testing:
- Use the Playwright MCP server for testing UI changes including styling. You need to build the code before testing using `npm run build`.
- The python http server is already running.
- The fixtures are in `agent-embed/js/src/__tests__/fixtures`, feel free to use and modify for testing.
- E.g of opening a fixter is: `http://localhost:8000/pd/agent-embed/js/src/__tests__/fixtures/lb-lh-std-input.html`

# Writing Unit tests
The plan should contain the instructions for writing unit tests:
- Write unit tests AFTER 1 - UI testing with playwright. 2 - `npm run build` works and no type errors.
- Follow the rules in `agent-embed/js/src/__rules__/test-rules.md` for writing the tests.

# ULTRA-THINKING DIRECTIVE
Before presenting the implementation plan, engage in extended thinking so the plan is as per 
 - The instructions in this command 
 - Covers all aspects mentioned in the `feature_spec`.

# FEATURE PLAN SAVING
When the implementation plan is ready, it should be written into the the directory in which the `feature_spec` lies.
